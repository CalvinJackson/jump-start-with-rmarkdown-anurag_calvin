# Introduction {#sec:intro}

This document is designed as a template for data lab projects.  However, it can
actually be used as one of general templates in `r proglang("R Markdown")` for a
single document.


The motivation of setting up a template in `r proglang("R Markdown")` is due to
its simple syntax and flexible output format with the help
of [`r pkg("pandoc")`][pandoc]. In addition, it is in favor of reproducible
studies, which have been receiving increasing attention in modern research.


Instead of providing a minimal but non-informative template framework, we review
most of the basic syntax of writing a single `r proglang("R Markdown")` document
with the power of `r pkg("bookdown")` [@xie2017bookdown] by examples. However,
it is not intended for a tutorial of `r proglang("R Markdown")` or
`r pkg("bookdown")` package.  Readers are encouraged to skim the PDF or HTML
output, and have a more close look at the source document of this template
directly.


The rest of this project template is organized as follows: In Section
\@ref(sec:cross), we briefly discuss about the cross-referencing of
`r proglang("R Markdown")`, which has a better support from
package `r pkg("bookdown")` [@xie2016bookdown] than
package `r pkg("rmarkdown")` [@allaire2016rmarkdown] now.
In Section \@ref(sec:math) and Section \@ref(sec:theorem),
we present the example of writing mathematical equations, and mathematical
environment for theorem, lemma, and definition, etc., respectively.
Some examples of reproducing figures and inclusion of existing ones
are given in Section \@ref(sec:figure).
The generation of table source and other `r proglang("R")` objects is discussed
in Section \@ref(sec:table). A brief demonstration of code chunk is given in
Section \@ref(sec:code). At last but not least, in Section \@ref(sec:summary),
we point readers to some external resources for further reading and more
advanced usage of `r pkg("bookdown")`.


# Cross-Reference by bookdown {#sec:cross}

Cross-reference of mathematical equations, tables, and figures used to be a pain
of using `r proglang("R markdown")`. Usually extra package, such as
`r pkg("kfigr")` [@koohafkan2015kfigr], and certain kind of extra labor was
needed for a automatic and satisfactory cross-referencing.  Fortunately,
package `r pkg("bookdown")` provides a much easier and consistent syntax for
cross-referencing now.


# Math Equations {#sec:math}

The inline math expressions are quoted by `$` in the source document, which is
consistent with the syntax of `r latex`. For instance, $x_i^2$, $\sin(x)$,
$\theta$ are inline expressions. The equations can be simply quoted by `$$` if
no cross-reference is needed, where regular `r latex` commands under math
environment can be used.  For equations that need cross-referencing,
`r latex` environments for mathematical equations, such as `equation`,
`align`, can be used directly. For example,
Equation \@ref(eq:eular) is the well-known Eular's identity.

\begin{align}
  e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta).  (\#eq:eular)
\end{align}


# Math Theorem Environments  {#sec:theorem}

The mathematical theorem can be put inside `theorem` chunk followed by its
label. For example, Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is presented in Theorem
\@ref(thm:clt).


```{theorem, clt}
**(Central Limit Theorem)** Let $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ be independent, identically
distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with finite expectation $\mu$, and
positive, finite variance $\sigma^2$, and set $S_n=X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n$, $n
\ge 1$. Then
$$
    \frac{\bar{S}_n - n\mu}{\sigma \sqrt{n}}\xrightarrow{L} N(0, 1)
    ~\mathrm{as}~n\rightarrow\infty.
$$
```

All the available theorem environments for mathematical theorem, lemma,
definition, etc, and their label prefix designed for cross-reference are
summarized in Table \@ref(tab:theorem-envs).

<!-- source extracted from bookdown package  -->
(ref:theorem-envs) Theorem environments in `r pkg("bookdown")`.

```{r theorem-envs, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(data.frame(
  Environment = names(bookdown:::theorem_abbr),
  `Printed Name` = unname(unlist(bookdown:::label_names_math)),
  `Label Prefix` = unname(bookdown:::theorem_abbr),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE, check.names = FALSE
), caption = '(ref:theorem-envs)', booktabs = TRUE)
```


The First Borel-Cantelli Lemma is given inside the `lemma` environment as shown
in Lemma \@ref(lem:bc).

```{lemma, bc}
**(First Borel-Cantelli Lemma)** Let $\{A_n\}_{n \ge 1}$ be a sequence of events
with
$$
    \sum_n P(A_n) < \infty.
$$
Then
$$
P(A_n~\mathrm{i.o.}) = P(\limsup\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty}) = 0.
$$
```

The Definition \@ref(def:example) is an example definition of a good template
just for demonstration.

```{definition, example}
This is a good template if readers are able to easily follow and write their own
stories based on it.
```


# Figures {#sec:figure}

Figures can be generated by the code chunk within the source document.  For
example, the quadratic M-splines [@ramsay1988msplines] with three internal knots
generated by `r pkg("splines2")` package [@wang2017splines2] are plotted by the
following `r proglang("R")` code chunk. The resulting plot is shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:mSplines).

<!-- caption of figure may be defined as follows: -->
(ref:cap-mSplines) Quadratic M-spline Bases with three internal knots.

```{r mSplines, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "(ref:cap-mSplines)"}
x <- seq.int(0, 1, 0.01)
knots <- c(0.3, 0.5, 0.6)
msMat <- mSpline(x, knots = knots, degree = 2, intercept = TRUE)
par(mar = c(2.5, 2.5, 0, 0), mgp = c(1.5, 0.5, 0))
matplot(x, msMat, type = "l", ylab = "M-splines")
abline(v = knots, lty = 2, col = "gray")
```


It is possible that we may not be able to regenerate the plot we want from
`r proglang("R")` code.  Instead of reproducing plots on the fly, we may also
include an existing figure into the document by the function
`knitr::include_graghics`. Suppose we have already generated a quadratic
I-splines by function `splines2::iSpline` and saved the plot under directory
`figs`. Then we may skip the regeneration step and include the existing plot
directly as follows:

(ref:cap-iSplines) Quadratic I-spline Bases with three internal knots.

```{r iSplines, echo = 10, fig.cap = "(ref:cap-iSplines)", message = FALSE}
## we generate the figure as below but not plot it out
if (! dir.exists("figs")) dir.create("figs")
png("figs/iSpline.png", width = 7, height = 4.5, units = "in", res = 192)
isMat <- iSpline(x, knots = knots, degree = 2, intercept = TRUE)
par(mar = c(2.5, 2.5, 0, 0), mgp = c(1.5, 0.5, 0))
matplot(x, isMat, type = "l", ylab = "I-splines")
abline(v = knots, lty = 2, col = "gray")
foo <- dev.off()
## include the figure generated
knitr::include_graphics("figs/iSpline.png")
```

We may set the chunk option `echo = FALSE` so that the code chunk generating the
plots are excluded from the output. Also, the chunk option `cache` can be set to
be `TRUE` for time-consuming code chunk once the code chunk is unlikely to be
modified.


# Tables and Other R objects {#sec:table}

Tables can be similarly generated by the code chunk within the source document.
Table \@ref(tab:theorem-envs) was in fact generated by function `knitr::kable`.
Another simple example of table generation by `knitr::kable` is given in the
follows code chunk. Table \@ref(tab:iris) is the resulting table.

(ref:iris) First six rows of the iris data in package `r pkg("datasets")`.

```{r iris, }
knitr::kable(head(iris), booktabs = TRUE,
             caption = '(ref:iris)')
```

There are other `r proglang("R")` packages that can be of tremendous help in
generating `r proglang("Markdown")` source of table and other `r proglang("R")`
objects.  For example, package `r pkg("xtable")` [@dahl2016xtable] provides a
more sophistic support for generation of table source for `r latex` and HTML;
Package `r pkg("pander")` [@daroczi2015pander] provides functions printing a
variety of `r proglang("R")` objects in `r pkg("pandoc")`'s
`r proglang("Markdown")`; Package `r latex` `r pkg("stargazer")`
[@hlavac2015stargazer] produces `r latex` code, HTML code and SCII text for
well-formatted tables for results from regression models.
See [CRAN task view][taskView] on reproducible research for a more comprehensive
package list.  .


# Code Chunk {#sec:code}

In addition to `r proglang("R")`, the code chunk can be written in a variety of
other languages, such as `r proglang("Bash")`, `r proglang("Python")`,
`r proglang("SAS")`, etc. by specifying the chunk option `engine`.
The following code chunk is one toy example written in `r proglang("Python 3")`.

<!-- note that we actually set eval to be FALSE here so that readers are able to
reproduce this template without Python 3. -->

```{r pythonCode, eval = FALSE, engine = "python", comment = ">>> "}
foo = "Hello " + "world!"
print("The legnth of '" + foo + "'" + ' is %d.' % len(foo))
```

<!-- The expected result is given as follows -->

```python
>>>  The legnth of 'Hello world!' is 12.
```

We may set the chunk option `eval = FALSE` if we only want to present the code
without evaluation.


# Summary and Discussion {#sec:summary}

In summary, we provided this project template and reviewed the basic syntax of
writing a single `r proglang("R Markdown")` document with the power and love of
`r pkg("bookdown")`.


@xie2017bookdown provided a thorough introduction to `r pkg("bookdown")`
including more advanced components, such as HTML widgets, and their usage.
What's more, the [manual][pandocManual] of `r pkg("Pandoc")` gives all the
available options that can be specified through `r proglang("YAML")` metadata
section.


The template source and other associated files, such as BibTeX file, are
available at the GitHub repository named [datalab-templates][repo].


# Acknowledgment {-}

We would like to thank Yihui and all the other authors, contributors for the
fabulous `r pkg("knitr")`, `r pkg("rmarkdown")`, and `r pkg("bookdown")`
packages. It would be also impossible for template to work without those
fantastic open-source software: `r proglang("R")`, `r pkg("pandoc")`, etc.
